      "summary": "Public documentation for Helldivers 2 does not indicate the use of a named third‑party anti‑cheat solution such as Easy Anti‑Cheat, BattlEye, or kernel‑level drivers, and PCGamingWiki and the Steam store page list only the usual platform DRM (Steam, PlayStation, Xbox) and a PlayStation Network account requirement for online play. There is no evidence of kernel‑level or highly invasive anti‑cheat components; instead, the game appears to rely on standard platform‑level protections and server‑side checks typical for a co‑op PvE title. As a result, its anti‑cheat/DRM profile is best characterized as standard rather than invasive, though details of any proprietary server‑side measures are not publicly documented.",
