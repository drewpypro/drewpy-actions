## Key Summary

Arc Raiders is a high-profile extraction shooter developed and published by Swedish studio Embark Studios, an experienced team backed by Nexon. The game’s identity and ownership are clear and well-documented, contributing to high confidence in the developer’s reputation and long-term support. On the downside, it employs Easy Anti-Cheat in a kernel-level configuration that persists unless manually removed, which many players would consider invasive from a privacy and control standpoint. Community sentiment on Steam is very positive, with roughly 89% positive reviews and record-breaking concurrent player numbers that signal strong engagement and general satisfaction despite some complaints about monetization and balance. Overall, the title scores well on identity and community reception but is held back somewhat by the invasiveness of its anti-cheat approach.

### Anti-Cheat & Client Risk (Score: 2/5)

According to the Steam store page, Arc Raiders uses Easy Anti-Cheat and explicitly notes that it is a kernel-level anti-cheat that requires manual removal after uninstalling the game. Kernel-level anti-cheat operates with very high system privileges and is therefore generally considered more invasive than standard user-mode solutions. While this approach is increasingly common in competitive and extraction-based shooters to combat cheating, it may be a concern for players who are sensitive to invasive anti-cheat or persistent services remaining after uninstall without manual cleanup.

**Anti-cheat type:** Easy Anti-Cheat (kernel-level)  
**Classification:** invasive

### Community Sentiment (Score: 5/5)

Steam label: **Very Positive**  
Positive review %: **89%**

On Steam, Arc Raiders currently holds a "Very Positive" user review summary, with approximately 89% of over 80,000 English-language user reviews marked positive and a similar rating across all languages, reflecting strong overall community sentiment. External coverage notes rapid player growth, record-breaking concurrent player peaks for an extraction shooter, and praise for the game’s satisfying PvPvE loop, visual style, and technical performance, though some criticism is directed at the cosmetic pricing and occasional balance frustrations. Overall, the community response is enthusiastic, with a large, active player base and sentiment that the game is one of the standout multiplayer releases of 2025.
